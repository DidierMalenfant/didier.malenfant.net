### An open-source fantasy gaming console for the Analog Pocket.

#### What is it?

Project Freedom's **pfx1** is a fantasy console, much like [pico8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), [tic-80](https://tic80.com) or [arduboy](https://www.arduboy.com), but for the Analog Pocket [OpenFPGA](https://www.analogue.co/developer) platform. There isn't much to see here yet but the main purpose of this site is to host a blob so that the journey can be documented.

#### Where can I get the latest updates?

You can find the project's repos for the [SDK](https://github.com/DidierMalenfant/pfSDK), the [Core](https://github.com/DidierMalenfant/pfCore) or the [Simulator](https://github.com/DidierMalenfant/pfSimulator) on Github or head over to the [main page](/) and look for posts with the ðŸ‘¾ icon.
