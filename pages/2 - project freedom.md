### An open-source fantasy gaming console for the Analog Pocket.

#### What is it?

Project Freedom's **pfx1** is a fantasy console, much like [pico8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), [tic-80](https://tic80.com) or [arduboy](https://www.arduboy.com), but for the Analog Pocket [OpenFPGA](https://www.analogue.co/developer) platform. There isn't much to see here yet but the main purpose of this site is to host a [blog](/blog/) so that the journey can be documented.
