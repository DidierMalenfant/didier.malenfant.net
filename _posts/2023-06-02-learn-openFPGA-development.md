As I continue my journey toward making the [pfx-1](https://didier.malenfant.net/ProjectFreedom/) console a reality, it has become painfully clear that information about developing for the Pocket's **openFPGA** platform is sometimes hard to come by. And when it **IS** available, it's lost somewhere behind a Discord or scattered in 4 different corners of the internet.

I've been keeping notes as I go along and that gave me the idea to put all my notes into a single place, accessible to all, and hopefully help people wanting to give **openFPGA** a try.

The result is [openFPGA Tutorials](https://github.com/DidierMalenfant/openFPGA-tutorials).

It's a work in progress but there is a [wiki](https://github.com/DidierMalenfant/openFPGA-tutorials/wiki) that will be populated with info and **FAQ** about the platform. A [discussion forum](https://github.com/DidierMalenfant/openFPGA-tutorials/discussions) will provide help to other developers and centralize all the questions in one place. More importantly answers will be easily searchable.

I'm also adding a bunch of sample code that is easy to build using [tools](https://github.com/DidierMalenfant/pfDevTools) I've developed for **Project Freedom** and can hopefully be great starting points for anyone getting started.

I hope this can help and create a little community where we can, in turn, help each other.
