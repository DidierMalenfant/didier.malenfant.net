**toybox.py** is a python version of <a href="https://github.com/jm/toybox" target="_blank">**toybox**</a>, originally created by  by <a href="https://github.com/jm" target="_blank">Jeremy McAnally</a>. Jeremy's project was written in **Go** and I really wanted to tweak a few things and experiment a bit with it but since I know nothing about **Go**, I decided to do a clean-room implementation of the same idea in **Python**. And so here we are :)

The project is heading toward a **0.0.1-alpha** release so I got <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@toyboxpy">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/toyboxpy">Twitter</a> and now this website all setup in preparation. Discussions will take place on <a href="https://github.com/DidierMalenfant/toybox.py/discussions">Github</a>.

I'm really excited about this little project and hopefully contribute something useful to the <a href="https://play.date" target="_blank">Playdate</a> community. I'll post on here when there are any updates.
